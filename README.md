# Demo to show issue with jspdf and Adobe Acrobat

Setup and execute

```js
npm i
npm start
```

The output [`proof.pdf`](https://github.com/febkosq8/jspdf-adobe-issue/blob/main/proof.pdf) if opened in Adobe Acrobat wont open the 4th page correctly.
If you open the same file in Chrome, it works without any issues.
